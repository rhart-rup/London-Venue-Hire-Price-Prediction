    "# Tagvenue Venue Web Scrape\n",
    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Tagvenue](https://www.tagvenue.com/) website is basically an Air BnB for finding and booking venues for an event. The website hosts thousands of venues in the UK that can be booked for events such as weddings, work drinks, birthdays etc. Each venue has one or more **spaces** available to be booked. A **space** is basically a room or area within the venue. Some venues have a single space, often the whole venue, whilst others offer a selection of rooms, each offered as a separate space. Each Space has its own webpage on Tagvenue. This webpage contains all the data needed to choose which space to book for your event. Example data includes price, location, size, capacity, features, licensing etc. This notebook will scrape the data from all spaces on the [Tagvenue](https://www.tagvenue.com/) website that are located in **London**. At the time of writing this amounts to **~4400** spaces. "

    "\n",
    "- **progress_report_interval** - Periodic progress reports (% completed) are printed during scraping. This variable defines in seconds how often the report is output. \n",
    "- **connection_error_retry_time** - This defines how long in seconds the program will wait before trying to re-load a webpage when it fails to load due to a connection error. \n",
    "- **headless_mode** - Set to *True* if you want chrome to be launched in headless mode i.e. not visible. Set to *False* if you wish chrome to be visible while scraping.  \n",
    "- **longitude_min**, **longitude_max**, **latitude_min** and **latitude_max** - Defines the area that will be searched for venues. The intersection of the four longitude / latitude lines defines a square area."

    "We will frequently load new webpages with Selenium. We want to wait a certain amount of time between successive page loads to minimise our impact on the server and avoid being detected as a bot. We also want to detect any connection errors that might occur during the loading of a page for example due to a wifi issue. \n",

It then pauses the program for twice the time it took for the page to load (with random variation to look less like a bot). In this way, the strain we put on the server will dynamically change. The slower the server becomes, the more time we will wait between successive page loads and vice versa if the server speeds up. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function also Handles *timeout* (page took longer than 30 seconds to load) and *connection* errors (couldn't connect to internet). In either case, the programme will wait some time then try to reload the page. If it still fails, the error is logged.  \n",
    "\n",
